						"Dr Boz, LLC asked Roy to program a tool to help solve a problem. The tool was new to the market. Roy had little experience with the tool. Roy went above and beyond to deliver what we needed. He researched the options thoroughly. We talked through the strategic options relative to performance, cost, & company growth. Roy pulled from his vast programming experience, product development, and systems integration. He thought more about the needs of our company than his programming needs. The ultimate solution required a difficult process for Roy, but one that fit our needs.  Roy's attitude, persistence, and quality programming delivered a perfect performance.  FIVE STAR RATING."

						"Roy Newcomb did outstanding work on our projects. He listened to our ideas as we sketched out our thoughts on the websites and he provided feedback on the project. We were impressed with how quickly he moved on the project and how thorough he was with every aspect of our design. Roy made suggestions for our website that would assist us for future additions to the site. We were so thankful and blessed to have Roy work on our project. We look forward to continue working with him in the future."
